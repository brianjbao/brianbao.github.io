excerpt: 'This study highlights a concerning gap in consent forms regarding exams under anesthesia performed by medical trainees. Out of 110 hospitals surveyed, only 4% mentioned exams under anesthesia in their consent forms, raising questions about patient awareness and consent in sensitive examinations. The findings stress the need for explicit consent to protect patient autonomy and trust, as many patients feel traumatized when they learn about unconsented exams. We call for standardized, comprehensible language in consent forms to uphold transparency and respect for patient rights.<br><br> *equally contributing first authors'
