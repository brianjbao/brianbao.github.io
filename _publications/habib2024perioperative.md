title: "Perioperative outcomes of branchial cleft sinus tract excision in pediatric patients without the use of intraoperative dye"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2024perioperative
excerpt: 'Branchial cleft anomalies are rare congenital neck masses that sometimes form sinus tracts, requiring surgery for removal. This study reviewed 118 pediatric surgeries without using methylene blue dye, a technique often employed to trace sinus tracts during the procedure. The findings showed no recurrences of the sinus tracts and minimal complications, suggesting that dye may not be necessary for successful outcomes. These results could reduce unnecessary costs and simplify procedures for patients and surgeons.'

Branchial cleft anomalies are rare congenital neck masses that sometimes form sinus tracts, requiring surgery for removal. This study reviewed 118 pediatric surgeries without using methylene blue dye, a technique often employed to trace sinus tracts during the procedure. The findings showed no recurrences of the sinus tracts and minimal complications, suggesting that dye may not be necessary for successful outcomes. These results could reduce unnecessary costs and simplify procedures for patients and surgeons.
