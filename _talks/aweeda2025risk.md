This oral presentation determined hypocalcemia rates and risk factors following total thyroid removal surgery in children. This work reviewed 67 studies with over 7,000 pediatric patients to determine how often transient (lasting under 6 months) and permanent (lasting over 6 months) hypocalcemia occur. Our results established that the pooled incidence rates were 32.1% for any hypocalcemia, 25.2% for transient hypocalcemia, and 7.4% for permanent hypocalcemia. We found thyroid cancer, Gravesâ€™ disease, and lymph node dissection to be risk factors for hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy in children.
