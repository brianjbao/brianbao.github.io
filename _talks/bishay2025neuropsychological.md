Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) is a treatment option for dystonia, but its effects on neuropsychological functions are not well understood. This poster examines whether DBS affects thinking and mood in patients with treatment-resistant dystonia by analyzing pre- and post-surgery neuropsychological test results. We found no significant changes in depression, anxiety, memory, attention, or other cognitive functions after surgery. These results suggest that GPi DBS is a safe treatment for treatment-resistant dystonia without negative effects on mental functions.
