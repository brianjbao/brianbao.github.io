This presentation discussed differences in policy implementation between strong and fragile Middle Eastern states during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fragile states instated restrictive policies more frequently, with no specific type of restriction accounting for the entire difference. Business regulation was the most notable restriction enforced by strong states.
