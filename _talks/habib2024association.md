This study aimed to assess the impact of neoadjuvant immunotherapy on surgical outcomes across six cancer types using the National Cancer Database. Among 953,612 patients who underwent non-palliative oncologic surgery, only 0.5% received neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The analysis found no significant association between neoadjuvant immunotherapy and major postoperative complications in rectal, colon, anal, esophageal, lung (non-small cell), or oral cancers. The findings suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy does not increase the risk of postoperative complications.
