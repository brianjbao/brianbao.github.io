The benefit of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over radiotherapy (RT) alone for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) patients with positive margins but no extranodal extension (ENE) remains unclear after two landmark clinical trials (EORTC 229311 and RTOG 95-01) included only a small minority of patients with positives margins and no ENE. Among a matched cohort of National Cancer Database (NCDB) patients with positive margins but no ENE, this [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/habib2025adjuvant-poster.pdf) found no overall survival (OS) benefit for CRT compared to RT alone. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine adjuvant therapy recommendations for specific high-risk groups.
