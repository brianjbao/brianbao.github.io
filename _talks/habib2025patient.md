This [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/habib2025patient-poster.pdf) describes how patients discharged the same day as their mastectomy often encounter non-routine events (NREs), or deviations from expected medical care, that can significantly impact their experience. Patients reported NREs such as post-surgical discomfort, communication gaps, and challenges navigating the hospital. While most NREs were mild and preventable, they highlight the need for addressing uncertainties and establishing a reliable line of communication during the transition from hospital to home.
