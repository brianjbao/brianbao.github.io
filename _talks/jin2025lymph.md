Lymph node yield (LNY) has been proposed as a quality metric in head and neck cancer care, but its impact on outcomes in total laryngectomy (TL) remains unclear. Analyzing 699 TL patients, this [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/jin2025lymph-poster.pdf) found that LNYâ‰¥18 was not independently associated with improved overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), or regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), even after adjusting for covariates. These findings suggest that LNY may not be a reliable standalone metric for predicting oncologic outcomes in TL patients.
