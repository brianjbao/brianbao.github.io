This study examines the impact of neoadjuvant immunotherapy on postoperative complications in various cancers. We analyzed data from over 950,000 cases involving curative-intent cancer surgery between 2010 and 2020, 0.5% of which were preceded by immunotherapy. Our findings indicate that neoadjuvant immunotherapy does not significantly increase postoperative major morbidity, suggesting surgery in the setting of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is safe.
